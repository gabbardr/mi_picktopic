    <title>Pick 10 Topic - Web Design as a Career</title>
</head>
<body>
    After taking this course, I was able to understand more programming than I was ever able to in the past.
    I attempted to take a course in a previous semester and quickly became overwhelmed and felt that I would never understand it.
    After a few classes, I decided that it was something that was too difficult to learn and dropped the class.
    When I started this class, I was nervous, but found that not every aspect is difficult and when taught the right way, parts can be actually really easy to learn!
    It peaked an interest and grew more excited to learn about it. While I still think I might encounter future problems, I feel much more comfortable in my abilities to solve them.
    With that being said, I feel like a career in web design might be something that I would rather enjoy doing in my future, so I decided to take a look into the career itself. 

    The first thing I looked into was how many different paths you can take into web design.
    It is no secret that it is a rapidly increasing need, so the different types of opportunities are endless.
    Many companies and individuals need a website for whatever reason but learning how to do to it yourself is time consuming and sometimes just not plausible.
    This means that any type of company or individual can become a client. I also learned that there are long-term and short-term projects.
    Some companies may want to hire someone for their team to be a permeant edition, and others for a singular project.
    I also found out there is a difference between a web designer and a web developer.
    The difference being that a designer focuses on the appearance and the developer works more with the functions of the site, meaning the backend programming.
    When trying to find a job, one of the most important tools will be a portfolio. Having a way to present your work to employers will demonstrate your skills as a designer.
    Depending on what type of job is taken, the salary can range most commonly from $30k-110k a year with $57k being the average. This being said, if this is something that you enjoy, it would be an amazing career path.
